The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected styling.  For example, if you have a style applied to an element using both a class and an ID, the ID selector will always override the class selector due to its higher specificity. This can be difficult to debug if you're not aware of how specificity works.  Another common issue is cascading stylesheets where styles from multiple sources (imported stylesheets, embedded styles, inline styles) conflict without clear indication of which one is actually being applied. This can lead to inconsistent styling across different parts of a web page.
