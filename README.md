# CSS Specificity and Cascading Stylesheet Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS: unexpected styling due to specificity and cascading stylesheet conflicts.  The `bug.css` file shows code that leads to incorrect styling, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution. The problem arises from conflicting styles with varying levels of specificity and the order in which stylesheets are imported or included.

Understanding CSS specificity and the cascading order is crucial for effective web development.
